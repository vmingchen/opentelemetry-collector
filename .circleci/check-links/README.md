# Markdown Link Checker

Check links in markdown docs based on
[`markdown-link-check`](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check).
The app in this repo has been updated to ignore 429 responses (too many
requests).

Update [config.json](./config.json) to exclude specific links from being
checked (e.g. examples or links requiring authentication).  See
[here](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check/blob/master/README.md#config-file-format)
for details and other options.
